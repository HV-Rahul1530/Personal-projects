1. **Project Description: Secure Password Manager**

I'm thrilled to introduce you to my latest creation – a Secure Password Manager built with Python. This project aims to help you keep your passwords safe and easily accessible while ensuring the highest level of security. Let me walk you through its key features:

Generating and Safeguarding Encryption Keys:
When you first launch the application, it automatically generates a unique encryption key and stores it securely in a designated file named `encryption_key.key`. This key serves as the guardian of your passwords, ensuring they remain confidential and tamper-proof.


- You provide the website or app name.
- Enter your username.
- Share your password.

Behind the scenes, the manager takes your password and encrypts it using the stored encryption key. It then saves this encrypted gem into a separate file named after the website or app, keeping your credentials safe and sound (e.g., `example.com.pwd`).

Retrieving Passwords:
Need to retrieve a stored password? It's just as straightforward:
- Tell the application the name of the website or app you're interested in.
- The application works its magic, decrypts the stored password, and presents it to you, just like magic.

Handling Errors Gracefully:
It handles situations where passwords are not found or if you happen to make an incorrect menu selection.

 Security:
This manager relies on the Fernet encryption library, known for its robust encryption capabilities. Your data is safe with us.

Streamlined Key Management:
You only have to generate that encryption key once – it's stored securely for consistent and reliable encryption and decryption.

User-Friendly Design:
I've put a lot of thought into making this manager easy to use, ensuring that even those with limited technical knowledge can keep their passwords organized and secure.
